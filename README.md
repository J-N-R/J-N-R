// INTRODUCTION // This page is still under development! I am working on migrating my existing code over to here.

Hello!


My Name is Jonathan Rivera, and I'm a student majoring in Cyber Security at Kean University.

This GitHub's purpose is to host all of my current and previous project files and to help me learn and work more closely with GitHub, and others' codes.


My interests right now include building up my skillset and finding an Internship that I will fit in well with.


As of Spring 2021, my most recent projects include:

  - Designing and implementing a simple, but powerful interval calculator app in Java that helped my team facilitate research nearly 50% more efficiently in 2020.
  
  - Designing and Deploying a series of Apache based websites in a Unix Environment with PHP that work closely with MySQL databases to simulate
    a Bank System with a working user login page, home page, as well as several web tools that allowed users to create new transactions,
    search through users' logged transactions for a specific keyword, display and modify all previous transactions, and more.
    
  - Designing and implementing several CGI programs written in C++, Java, and Python in a Unix Environment that interfaced with Apache based websites to process
    user requests, such as: a program that simulated SQL's Join, Order By, and Group By functions to process two given CSV files into a user friendly table, and
    a program that facilitated the openweather API and a GEO-IP API to relay to a user information about their current location, such as time-zone, temperature, and more.
    

My current skills include programming in Java, C++, Python, HTML, PHP and SQL (MariaDB), and as I am still learning and trying to strengthen my skills, I am looking to
collaborate on any opportunity or project that might make use these skills so I may practice and become a better programmer.
