## Hello!


#### My Name is Jonathan Rivera, and I'm a fourth year cyber security student from Kean University.

This GitHub's purpose is to host all of my current and previous project files and to help me learn and work more closely with GitHub, and others' codes. <br/><br/>


## Recent Projects:

  - Is Covid Near Me? A simple full stack web app that allows users to input their state and county and get accurate and understandable results instantly.

  - The History of Covid. A more substantial full stack web app that allows any user to see the state of Covid-19 around the world at any date, with support for many data visualizations to allow users to see correlations as well as the cause and affect of many health policies.
    
<br/><br/>Many of my projects are developed in a Unix Environment! Because of this, I have a lot of experience working without the help of an IDE, as well as understand many of the nice functionalities that unix provides, such as bash scripts and regular cronjobs.

<br/><br/>My current skills include programming in Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, AJAX, PHP and SQL (MariaDB). As a student, my main goal is to learn more, as well to put my skills to good use, so I'm always looking out for new opportunities and projects! 
 
 
<br/><br/>If you have any questions or would like to contact me,

You can reach me at my email: rivejona@kean.edu, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
