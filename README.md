## Hello!


#### My Name is Jonathan Rivera, and I'm a cyber security graduate from Kean University.

This GitHub's purpose is to host all of my current and previous project files and to help me learn and work more closely with GitHub, and others' codes. <br/><br/>

## Recent work
After graduating from school and getting a job, I've since been working on fun side projects relating to modding the game Sonic Adventure 2. This includes creating fully fledged UI apps as well as C++ libraries and scripts to modify game code directly. These projects are...

  - [My Level Mod](https://github.com/J-N-R/My-Level-Mod), a suite of C++ libraries and scripts to help modders to import custom assets into the game.

  - Modern Set Editor (wip, currently private), an ElectronJS app powered by Angular that allows users to edit the 'SET' binary files found in the game. 

## Other projects:

  - BillChop! A full stack web app that uses AI to read a photo of a reciept, and allow you to easily split items on the bill with your friends.

  - Is Covid Near Me? A simple full stack web app that allows users to input their state and county and get accurate and understandable results instantly.

  - The History of Covid. A more substantial full stack web app that allows any user to see the state of Covid-19 around the world at any date, with support for many data visualizations to allow users to see correlations as well as the cause and affect of many health policies.
    
<br/><br/>Many of my projects are developed in a Unix Environment! Because of this, I have a lot of experience working without the help of an IDE, and I've learned how to use many of the nice functionalities that unix provides, such as bash scripts and regular cronjobs.

<br/>My current skills include programming in Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, AJAX, PHP and SQL (MariaDB). As a student, my main goal is to learn more, as well to put my skills to good use, so I'm always looking out for new opportunities and projects!
