## Hello!
**My Name is Jonathan Rivera, and I'm a full-stack developer from Kean University.**

I enjoy using programming to help inform and upbuild underserved communites, and I love building tools that help can people. 

This GitHub's purpose is to host all of my current and previous project files and to help me learn and work more closely with GitHub, and others' codes. <br/><br/>

## Recent work
While I have been a bit busy since getting my first full-time job, I still work on fun side projects from time to time. My most recent projects relate to modding one of my favorite games, Sonic Adventure 2. These tools were created to help others create their first video game mod and to introduce newcomers to programming for Sonic Adventure 2 in C++. These projects are...

  - [Modern Set Editor](https://github.com/J-N-R/Set-File-Editor), an Angular/ElectronJS-powered desktop app that allows users to edit the 'SET' file format commonly used in the game. 

  - [My Level Mod](https://github.com/J-N-R/My-Level-Mod), a suite of C++ libraries and scripts to help modders to import custom assets into the game.

## Other projects:

  - BillChop! A full stack web app that uses AI to read a photo of a reciept, and allows you to easily split items on the bill with your friends. Includes shared, live sessions where your friends can choose items on the bill to pay for, which you can see happen on your device in real time.

  - Is Covid Near Me? A simple full stack web app that allows users to input their state and county and get accurate and understandable results instantly.

  - The History of Covid. A more substantial full stack web app that allows any user to see the state of Covid-19 around the world at any date, with support for many data visualizations to allow users to see correlations as well as the cause and affect of many health policies.
    
<br/><br/>Many of my projects are developed in a Unix Environment! Because of this, I have a lot of experience working without the help of an IDE, and I've learned how to use many of the nice functionalities that unix provides, such as bash scripts and regular cronjobs.

<br/>My current skills include programming in Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, AJAX, PHP and SQL (MariaDB). As a student, my main goal is to learn more, as well to put my skills to good use, so I'm always looking out for new opportunities and projects!
